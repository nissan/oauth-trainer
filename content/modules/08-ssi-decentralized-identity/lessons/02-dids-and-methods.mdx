## Understanding Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)


A **Decentralized Identifier (DID)** is a new type of identifier that is globally unique, resolvable with high availability, and cryptographically verifiable. DIDs are the foundation of Self-Sovereign Identity.

## DID Syntax

DIDs follow a simple URI scheme:

```
did:method:method-specific-identifier
```

**Examples:**
```
did:ethr:0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678
did:web:example.com:user:alice
did:key:z6MkpTHR8VNsBxYAAWHut2Geadd9jSwuBV8xRoAnwWsdvktH
did:ion:EiClWZ5MQmYPkjGkU0T4WD9Ar7z8E6fL2aB1Hd5zPsU3dA
```

### DID Components

1. **Scheme**: Always `did:`
2. **Method**: The DID method (determines how to create/resolve)
3. **Method-Specific Identifier**: Unique within that method

## DID Documents

When you resolve a DID, you get back a **DID Document** - a JSON-LD document containing:

- **Verification Methods**: Public keys for cryptographic verification
- **Authentication**: Which keys can authenticate as this DID
- **Service Endpoints**: Where to contact the DID subject
- **DID Controller**: Who controls this DID

### Example DID Document

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
    "https://w3id.org/security/suites/ed25519-2020/v1"
  ],
  "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
  "controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",

  "verificationMethod": [{
    "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1",
    "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2020",
    "controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
    "publicKeyMultibase": "zH3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
  }, {
    "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-2",
    "type": "JsonWebKey2020",
    "controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
    "publicKeyJwk": {
      "kty": "OKP",
      "crv": "Ed25519",
      "x": "VCpo2LMLhn6iWku8MKvSLg2ZAoC-nlOyPVQaO3FxVeQ"
    }
  }],

  "authentication": [
    "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1",
    {
      "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-2",
      "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2020",
      "controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
      "publicKeyMultibase": "zH3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
    }
  ],

  "assertionMethod": [
    "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1"
  ],

  "capabilityInvocation": [
    "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1"
  ],

  "capabilityDelegation": [
    "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1"
  ],

  "keyAgreement": [{
    "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-3",
    "type": "X25519KeyAgreementKey2020",
    "controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
    "publicKeyMultibase": "z9hFgmPVfmBZwRvFEyniQDBkz9LmV7gDEqytWyGZLmDXE"
  }],

  "service": [{
    "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#vcs",
    "type": "VerifiableCredentialService",
    "serviceEndpoint": "https://example.com/vc/"
  }, {
    "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#hub",
    "type": "IdentityHub",
    "serviceEndpoint": "https://hub.example.com/.identity/did:example:123456789abcdefghi"
  }]
}
```

### Verification Relationships

DID Documents define multiple verification relationships:

| Relationship | Purpose | Use Case |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| **authentication** | Prove you control this DID | Login, DID Auth |
| **assertionMethod** | Sign Verifiable Credentials | Issue credentials as this DID |
| **keyAgreement** | Establish encrypted communication | DIDComm messaging |
| **capabilityInvocation** | Invoke cryptographic capabilities | Smart contract interaction |
| **capabilityDelegation** | Delegate capabilities to others | Allow agent to act on your behalf |

## DID Resolution

**DID Resolution** is the process of retrieving a DID Document from a DID.

```
Input:  did:ethr:0x1234...
        ↓
      [DID Resolver]
        ↓
Output: DID Document (JSON)
```

### Resolution Process

1. **Parse DID**: Extract method (`ethr`) and identifier (`0x1234...`)
2. **Method-Specific Resolution**: Call the appropriate resolver for that method
3. **Retrieve Document**: Fetch from blockchain, web server, IPFS, etc.
4. **Validate**: Ensure document is valid and not revoked
5. **Return**: DID Document in JSON-LD format

### Universal Resolver

The **Universal Resolver** (dev.uniresolver.io) supports 80+ DID methods:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://dev.uniresolver.io/1.0/identifiers/did:ethr:0x1234..."
```

Returns the DID Document for any supported method.
          

## DID Methods Comparison


There are 150+ DID methods registered with W3C. Let's compare the most popular ones.

## did:key - Simplest (No Blockchain)

**Philosophy:** A DID that's just a public key, nothing more.

**Format:**
```
did:key:z6MkpTHR8VNsBxYAAWHut2Geadd9jSwuBV8xRoAnwWsdvktH
```

**How it works:**
1. Generate a public/private key pair
2. Encode the public key in multibase format
3. Prefix with `did:key:`
4. **No registration anywhere**. The DID itself contains all information.

**DID Document (derived on-the-fly):**
```json
{
  "id": "did:key:z6MkpTHR8VNsBxYAAWHut2Geadd9jSwuBV8xRoAnwWsdvktH",
  "verificationMethod": [{
    "id": "did:key:z6MkpTHR8VNsBxYAAWHut2Geadd9jSwuBV8xRoAnwWsdvktH#z6MkpTHR8VNsBxYAAWHut2Geadd9jSwuBV8xRoAnwWsdvktH",
    "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2020",
    "controller": "did:key:z6MkpTHR8VNsBxYAAWHut2Geadd9jSwuBV8xRoAnwWsdvktH",
    "publicKeyMultibase": "z6MkpTHR8VNsBxYAAWHut2Geadd9jSwuBV8xRoAnwWsdvktH"
  }],
  "authentication": ["did:key:z6MkpTHR8VNsBxYAAWHut2Geadd9jSwuBV8xRoAnwWsdvktH#z6MkpTHR8VNsBxYAAWHut2Geadd9jSwuBV8xRoAnwWsdvktH"]
}
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ **Simplest** - No blockchain, no registration, no network needed
- ✅ **Offline** - Works completely offline
- ✅ **Free** - No transaction costs
- ✅ **Fast** - Instant creation and resolution
- ✅ **Perfect for testing**

**Cons:**
- ❌ **No key rotation** - Can't update keys without changing DID
- ❌ **No service endpoints** - Can't add contact information
- ❌ **No multi-key** - Only one key per DID
- ❌ **Temporary use only** - Not suitable for long-lived identities

**Best for:** Testing, temporary sessions, peer-to-peer connections, development

## did:web - DNS-Based (Familiar Infrastructure)

**Philosophy:** Use existing web infrastructure for DIDs.

**Format:**
```
did:web:example.com
did:web:example.com:user:alice
did:web:example.com:path:to:document
```

**How it works:**
1. Host a DID Document on your web server
2. Serve it at a well-known location:
   - `https://example.com/.well-known/did.json`
   - `https://example.com/user/alice/did.json`

**Resolution:**
```
did:web:example.com:user:alice
         ↓
GET https://example.com/user/alice/did.json
         ↓
Return DID Document
```

**Example did.json:**
```json
{
  "id": "did:web:example.com:user:alice",
  "verificationMethod": [{
    "id": "did:web:example.com:user:alice#key-1",
    "type": "EcdsaSecp256k1VerificationKey2019",
    "controller": "did:web:example.com:user:alice",
    "publicKeyJwk": {
      "kty": "EC",
      "crv": "secp256k1",
      "x": "NtngWpJUr-rlNNbs0u-Aa8e16OwB5NbZB0HgZwgjA0M",
      "y": "h0kkuJU4H2-l_7dUfB4HpbZqPDlPkIKWH9k8YUYkd8M"
    }
  }],
  "authentication": ["did:web:example.com:user:alice#key-1"],
  "service": [{
    "id": "did:web:example.com:user:alice#hub",
    "type": "IdentityHub",
    "serviceEndpoint": "https://hub.example.com"
  }]
}
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ **Familiar** - Uses existing web infrastructure (DNS, HTTPS)
- ✅ **Easy setup** - Just host a JSON file
- ✅ **No blockchain** - No transaction costs or delays
- ✅ **Key rotation** - Update the file to change keys
- ✅ **Service endpoints** - Full DID Document support
- ✅ **Trust transfer** - If you trust example.com, you trust did:web:example.com

**Cons:**
- ❌ **Centralized** - Depends on DNS and web hosting
- ❌ **Not censorship-resistant** - Domain can be seized
- ❌ **Requires HTTPS** - SSL certificate management
- ❌ **Single point of failure** - If server down, DID unreachable

**Best for:** Organizations with existing web presence, enterprise SSI, government digital IDs

**Real-world examples:**
- `did:web:identity.foundation` - Decentralized Identity Foundation
- `did:web:did.actor:alice` - DID hosting service

## did:ethr - Ethereum Blockchain

**Philosophy:** Anchor DIDs to Ethereum addresses, leverage smart contract ecosystem.

**Format:**
```
did:ethr:0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678
did:ethr:mainnet:0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678
did:ethr:0x1:0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678  // Mainnet
did:ethr:0x89:0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678  // Polygon
```

**How it works:**
1. Your Ethereum address IS your DID
2. DID Document stored/updated via **ERC-1056 DID Registry** smart contract
3. Pay gas fees to update document

**ERC-1056 Registry Operations:**
```solidity
// Add a public key
function setAttribute(address identity, bytes32 name, bytes value, uint validity) public;

// Add a delegate (another key that can act on your behalf)
function addDelegate(address identity, bytes32 delegateType, address delegate, uint validity) public;

// Revoke a delegate
function revokeDelegate(address identity, bytes32 delegateType, address delegate) public;
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ **Decentralized** - No central authority (Ethereum blockchain)
- ✅ **Ethereum ecosystem** - Works with smart contracts, wallets
- ✅ **Key rotation** - Update keys via smart contract
- ✅ **Delegates** - Allow others to act on your behalf (time-limited)
- ✅ **Established** - Battle-tested, widely supported

**Cons:**
- ❌ **Gas fees** - Costs money to update DID Document (varies with network)
- ❌ **Not offline** - Need Ethereum node to resolve
- ❌ **Slow** - Block confirmation times (12 seconds on mainnet)
- ❌ **Blockchain bloat** - Every update stored on-chain

**Best for:** Ethereum dApps, crypto wallets, blockchain-native applications

**Cost example (2025):**
- Create DID: Free (just use your address)
- Add public key: ~0.002 ETH (~$5) on mainnet, ~$0.01 on Polygon
- Update delegate: ~0.001 ETH (~$2.50)

## did:ion - Microsoft's ION (Bitcoin + IPFS)

**Philosophy:** Combine Bitcoin's security with IPFS scalability (Sidetree protocol).

**Format:**
```
did:ion:EiClWZ5MQmYPkjGkU0T4WD9Ar7z8E6fL2aB1Hd5zPsU3dA
```

**How it works:**
1. Create DID operations (create, update, recover, deactivate)
2. Batch thousands of operations together
3. Store batch in **IPFS** (content-addressed storage)
4. Anchor IPFS hash to **Bitcoin blockchain**
5. Result: Thousands of DID operations in one Bitcoin transaction

**Architecture:**
```
  DID Operations (create, update)
         ↓
   Batch Operations
         ↓
  Store in IPFS → CID: QmXoypiz...
         ↓
  Anchor CID to Bitcoin
         ↓
  Bitcoin TX: 1 satoshi + OP_RETURN with CID
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ **Highly scalable** - Thousands of DIDs per Bitcoin transaction
- ✅ **Low cost** - Amortized cost across batches (~$0.01 per DID)
- ✅ **Bitcoin security** - Inherits Bitcoin's immutability
- ✅ **IPFS resilience** - Content-addressed, distributed storage
- ✅ **Key rotation** - Full DID Document updates supported
- ✅ **Microsoft backing** - Production-ready, used in Microsoft Entra

**Cons:**
- ❌ **Complex** - Most sophisticated DID method
- ❌ **Not instant** - Batching delay (typically 10-15 minutes)
- ❌ **Requires ION node** - Or rely on public nodes (trust issue)
- ❌ **IPFS dependency** - Need IPFS gateway to resolve

**Best for:** Enterprise SSI at scale, government digital IDs, long-lived identities

**Real-world usage:**
- Microsoft Entra Verified ID
- Some EU Digital Identity Wallet implementations
