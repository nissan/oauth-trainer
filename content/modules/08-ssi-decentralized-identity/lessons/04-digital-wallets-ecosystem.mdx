## Digital Identity Wallets


## What Are Digital Identity Wallets?

**Digital Identity Wallets** are software applications that store and manage your:
- Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)
- Verifiable Credentials (VCs)
- Private keys for cryptographic operations
- Verifiable Presentations (VPs) you've created

**Think of it as:**
- Apple Wallet/Google Pay... but for your entire digital identity
- Your physical wallet... but containing diplomas, licenses, and certificates
- A password manager... but storing proofs instead of passwords

## Wallet Types

### 1. Mobile Wallets (Most Common)

**Examples:**
- **EU Digital Identity Wallet** (eIDAS 2.0 - launching 2026)
- **Microsoft Authenticator** (with Entra Verified ID support)
- **Trinsic Wallet** (enterprise SSI)
- **Lissi Wallet** (European SSI)

**Use Cases:**
- Store government IDs, driver's licenses
- Educational credentials (diplomas, certifications)
- Employment verification
- Access to services (hotels, car rentals, age verification)

**Features:**
- Biometric protection (Face ID, fingerprint)
- Cloud backup (encrypted)
- QR code presentation
- NFC sharing (tap-to-share)

### 2. Browser-Based Wallets

**Examples:**
- **Spruce Wallet** (DIDKit-based)
- **Bloom Wallet** (identity + credit)
- **Dock Wallet** (web + mobile)

**Use Cases:**
- Login to websites with DIDs (DID Auth)
- Prove credentials for SaaS access
- Professional networking (LinkedIn alternative)

**Features:**
- Browser extension
- Website integration
- Cross-device sync
- Export/import credentials

### 3. Hardware Wallets (High Security)

**Examples:**
- **YubiKey** (with FIDO2 + DID support)
- **Ledger** (cryptocurrency wallet with DID)
- **Trezor** (with SSI extensions)

**Use Cases:**
- High-value credentials (property deeds, stock certificates)
- Government/military applications
- Healthcare records (HIPAA compliance)

**Features:**
- Physical device required
- Air-gapped security
- Tamper-proof
- Multi-signature support

### 4. Custodial vs. Non-Custodial

**Non-Custodial (Recommended):**
```
You control your private keys
├─ Keys stored on your device
├─ You are responsible for backup
├─ No one can access without your permission
└─ True self-sovereign identity
```

**Custodial (Easier but Less Sovereign):**
```
Provider holds your keys
├─ Keys stored on provider's servers
├─ Provider can recover your account
├─ Provider can access your credentials
└─ Easier UX, but trust required
```

**Industry trend:** Moving towards non-custodial with social recovery mechanisms.

## Wallet Capabilities

### Core Functions

1. **DID Management**
   - Generate new DIDs (did:key, did:web, did:ion)
   - Store multiple DIDs for different contexts
   - Export DID for use in other wallets
   - Update DID Documents

2. **Credential Storage**
   - Receive credentials from issuers
   - Organize by type, issuer, or expiration
   - Search and filter credentials
   - Archive expired credentials

3. **Presentation Creation**
   - Select credentials to share
   - Create Verifiable Presentations
   - Sign with your DID
   - Apply selective disclosure

4. **Verification**
   - Verify incoming credentials before storing
   - Check issuer trust
   - Validate signatures
   - Check revocation status

5. **Backup & Recovery**
   - Encrypted cloud backup
   - Seed phrase recovery (12-24 words)
   - Social recovery (trusted contacts)
   - Multi-device sync

## DIDComm Protocol

**DIDComm** is the secure, private messaging protocol for SSI.

### What Problem Does It Solve?

**Traditional messaging:**
```
Alice → Email → Gmail Server → Bob
         ↓
    Google reads everything
    Metadata exposed (who, when, subject)
    No forward secrecy
```

**DIDComm:**
```
Alice → Encrypted Message → Bob
         ↓
    End-to-end encrypted
    Metadata protected
    Forward secrecy
    Repudiable (can't prove Alice sent it)
```

### DIDComm Message Structure

```json
{
  "id": "1234567890",
  "type": "https://didcomm.org/present-proof/3.0/request-presentation",
  "from": "did:example:verifier",
  "to": ["did:example:alice"],
  "created_time": 1516269022,
  "expires_time": 1516385931,
  "body": {
    "challenge": "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6",
    "domain": "employer.com",
    "presentation_definition": {
      "input_descriptors": [{
        "constraints": {
          "fields": [{
            "path": ["$.credentialSubject.degree.type"],
            "filter": { "const": "BachelorDegree" }
          }]
        }
      }]
    }
  }
}
```

**Key Features:**

- **type**: What kind of message (credential offer, presentation request, etc.)
- **from/to**: DIDs of sender and recipient(s)
- **body**: Encrypted payload
- **Forward secrecy**: Each message uses unique encryption keys

### Common DIDComm Protocols

1. **Present Proof Protocol**
   - Verifier requests presentation
   - Holder selects credentials
   - Holder creates and sends VP
   - Verifier verifies and responds

2. **Issue Credential Protocol**
   - Holder requests credential
   - Issuer creates credential
   - Issuer sends signed VC
   - Holder stores in wallet

3. **Trust Ping Protocol**
   - Check if DID is reachable
   - Establish connection
   - Test encryption

4. **Routing Protocol**
   - Route messages through mediators
   - Support for mobile devices (push notifications)
   - NAT traversal

    }
  }

  const response = await client.createIssuanceRequest(issuanceRequest)
  return response.url // QR code URL for employee to scan

## Privacy & Security Considerations

### Privacy Wins

✅ **Selective Disclosure**: Share only what's needed
✅ **Minimal Data**: No unnecessary attributes collected
✅ **User Control**: You decide when to share
✅ **No Tracking**: Verifiers can't correlate across services (with proper DID usage)
✅ **Data Sovereignty**: You own your data

### Privacy Risks

⚠️ **Correlation via DID**: Using same DID everywhere = trackable
**Solution:** Use different DIDs for different contexts (pairwise DIDs)

⚠️ **Issuer Knows**: Issuer knows they gave you a credential
**Solution:** Blind signatures (issuer signs without seeing content)

⚠️ **Verifier Surveillance**: Verifiers could build databases of who presented what
**Solution:** Privacy-preserving verification, ephemeral sessions

### Security Best Practices

1. **Key Management**
   - Use hardware wallets for high-value credentials
   - Regular backups (encrypted)
   - Multi-signature for important operations

2. **Revocation Monitoring**
   - Check revocation status before presenting
   - Subscribe to issuer's revocation updates
   - Automatic expiration for sensitive credentials

3. **Wallet Attestation**
   - Verify wallet software integrity
   - Use wallets from trusted providers
   - Enable app-level biometric protection

4. **Phishing Resistance**
   - Verify verifier's DID before presenting
   - Check domain in presentation request
   - Use wallets with built-in verification

## The Future of Digital Wallets

### 2025-2026 (Near Term)

- **EU Wallet Rollout**: 80% of EU citizens with digital wallet
- **US mDL Expansion**: All 50 states offering mobile driver's licenses
- **Enterprise Adoption**: Major corporations deploying employee credential wallets
- **Banking Integration**: Verifiable credentials for KYC, replacing document uploads

### 2027-2030 (Medium Term)

- **Global Interoperability**: EU wallets work in US, Asia-Pacific
- **Credential Marketplace**: Buy/sell verified credentials (not personal info, but proofs)
- **Social Recovery Standard**: Lose device? Trusted contacts help recover
- **Biometric Binding**: Credentials cryptographically tied to biometrics

### 2030+ (Long Term)

- **Born Digital**: Children receive DIDs at birth
- **Lifelong Credentials**: From birth certificate to death certificate, all digital
- **AI-Assisted Verification**: AI agents verify credentials on your behalf
- **Quantum-Resistant**: Credentials protected against quantum computers

## Key Takeaways

1. **Digital Wallets** store DIDs, VCs, and keys - your complete digital identity

2. **DIDComm** provides secure, private, peer-to-peer messaging for SSI

3. **Real Implementations** are already deployed: EU wallets (2026), Microsoft Entra, mDLs

4. **Ecosystem Standards** (W3C, DIF, ISO) ensure interoperability

5. **Privacy by Design**: Selective disclosure, minimal data, user control

6. **Enterprise Adoption** is accelerating in finance, healthcare, education, government

**This is not hypothetical.** SSI is being deployed at scale right now. The question is whether you'll be ready.
