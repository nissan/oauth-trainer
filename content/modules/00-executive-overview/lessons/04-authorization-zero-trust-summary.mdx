## Module 6: Fine-Grained Authorization - Beyond Roles

### What Problem Does This Solve?

**In plain English:** How do you handle complex permission scenarios like "Alice can edit documents she created or that were shared with her, but only if they're not marked confidential"?

### The Authorization Evolution

#### Level 1: Access Control Lists (ACLs) - 1970s
**Simple:** User X can access File Y
```
alice → can read → document.pdf
bob → can write → document.pdf
```

**Problem:** Doesn't scale. What about 1 million files and 10,000 users?

#### Level 2: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) - 1990s
**Better:** Users have roles, roles have permissions
```
alice → has role "Editor"
"Editor" → can create, read, update documents
```

**Problem:** Role explosion. "Editor who can delete on Mondays in the Chicago office" = too many roles.

#### Level 3: Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) - 2000s
**More flexible:** Policies based on attributes
```
ALLOW if:
  user.department == resource.department
  AND resource.classification != "top-secret"
```

**Problem:** Hard to reason about. "Who has access to this file?" = complex query.

#### Level 4: Relationship-Based Access Control (ReBAC) - 2010s+
**Modern:** Authorization based on relationships in a graph
```
alice → owner → folder1
folder1 → parent → document.pdf
∴ alice can access document.pdf (via ownership chain)
```

**Example:** Google Drive (if you can access folder, you can access files inside)

### Google Zanzibar - The Game Changer

#### What Is It?

**The real-world authorizer behind:**
- Google Drive (billions of sharing decisions)
- Google Calendar
- YouTube (channel permissions)
- Google Cloud (IAM)
- Google Photos

**Scale:** Handles 10+ million requests per second with 95th percentile latency `<10`ms

#### The Core Idea

**Everything is a relationship:**
```
user:alice → owner → doc:1
user:bob → editor → doc:1
user:charlie → viewer → folder:2
doc:1 → parent → folder:2

Question: "Can charlie view doc:1?"
Answer: Yes (charlie → viewer → folder:2, and doc:1 is in folder:2)
```

**Why it's powerful:** Handles nested permissions, inheritance, and complex sharing naturally.

### Modern Authorization Systems

#### Amazon Cedar
**What:** Policy-as-code authorization language (like writing firewall rules)

**Who uses it:** AWS Verified Permissions, AWS AVP

**Best for:** Cloud-native apps, attribute-heavy scenarios, AWS ecosystem

**Example policy:**
```cedar
permit (
  principal,
  action == Action::"viewDocument",
  resource
) when {
  principal.department == resource.department
  && resource.classification != "top-secret"
};
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Very expressive (complex conditions)
- ✅ Static analysis (find policy conflicts before deployment)
- ✅ AWS integration

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Steep learning curve
- ⚠️ Policy debugging can be hard

#### OpenFGA (Open-source Zanzibar)
**What:** Auth0's open-source implementation of Zanzibar

**Who uses it:** Okta (Auth0's parent), thousands of startups

**Best for:** Google Drive-style sharing, relationship-heavy authorization

**Example:**
```
user:alice has owner relationship with doc:1
user:bob has editor relationship with doc:1

Check: Can bob edit doc:1? → Yes
Check: Can bob delete doc:1? → No (only owners can delete)
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Proven model (Google's architecture)
- ✅ Great for multi-tenancy
- ✅ Intuitive for engineers

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Need to model relationships carefully
- ⚠️ Learning curve for graph thinking

#### SpiceDB
**What:** Most mature open-source Zanzibar implementation

**Who uses it:** Red Hat, Carta, Segment, hundreds of enterprises

**Best for:** Production-grade ReBAC with enterprise support

**Pros:**
- ✅ Battle-tested (AuthZed's managed offering)
- ✅ Excellent documentation
- ✅ Built-in consistency guarantees

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ More complex to self-host
- ⚠️ Managed service has costs

### When Do You Need This?

#### ✅ You NEED Fine-Grained Authorization If:

1. **Multi-Tenancy SaaS**
   - Example: Notion, Slack, GitHub
   - Users create workspaces, invite members, share resources
   - Complex: "Can alice edit doc in workspace she was invited to as editor?"

2. **Document Management / Collaboration**
   - Example: Google Drive, Dropbox, Box
   - Nested folders with inherited permissions
   - Sharing at multiple levels

3. **Cloud Infrastructure**
   - Example: AWS, GCP, Azure
   - Complex IAM policies across projects/accounts
   - "Who has access to this S3 bucket?"

4. **Healthcare / Financial Services**
   - Example: Patient records, financial accounts
   - Regulatory requirements (HIPAA minimum necessary access)
   - Fine-grained audit trails

#### ❌ You DON'T Need This If:

1. **Simple B2C app** with basic roles (Admin, User)
2. **Internal tool** with 20 users
3. **Read-only public content** (blogs, documentation)
4. **Single-tenant** with no sharing

**Reality Check:** 90% of apps can use simple RBAC. Only implement fine-grained authz when you actually need it.

### Decision Framework: Which System?

| Scenario | Recommended System | Why |
|----------|-------------------|-----|
| **Google Drive clone** | OpenFGA or SpiceDB | Relationship-heavy, proven model |
| **AWS-native app** | Amazon Cedar | Native AWS integration, policy-based |
| **Multi-tenant B2B SaaS** | OpenFGA or SpiceDB | Workspace/org hierarchies |
| **Healthcare platform** | Cedar or Oso | Policy-based, audit requirements |
| **Simple RBAC** | Casbin or Auth0 RBAC | Don't overcomplicate |

### Business Impact

#### Security Improvements
- **Least privilege:** Grant minimum necessary access (HIPAA, PCI-DSS requirement)
- **Audit compliance:** Answer "Who has access?" in real-time
- **Reduce breaches:** 34% of breaches involve over-privileged accounts

#### Developer Productivity
- **Centralized logic:** Authorization in one place, not scattered
- **Faster features:** "Add sharing" becomes configuration, not code
- **Easier audits:** Compliance teams can review policies

#### Scalability
- **Support growth:** Handle billions of permission checks (Zanzibar proven)
- **Multi-tenancy:** Add customers without performance degradation
- **Global distribution:** Low-latency checks worldwide

### Real-World Examples

#### Example 1: Notion's Authorization
**Challenge:** Users create pages, databases, share with teams, nested hierarchies

**Solution:** Zanzibar-inspired model
```
user:alice → member → team:engineering
team:engineering → can_edit → workspace:acme
workspace:acme → contains → page:roadmap
∴ alice can edit page:roadmap
```

#### Example 2: GitHub's Authorization
**Challenge:** Repos, orgs, teams, fine-grained permissions

**Model:**
```
user:alice → member → team:backend
team:backend → write → repo:api
org:acme → owns → repo:api
∴ alice can push to repo:api (via team membership)
```

#### Example 3: Healthcare Patient Records
**Challenge:** HIPAA minimum necessary access

**Cedar policy:**
```cedar
permit (
  principal,
  action == Action::"viewRecord",
  resource
) when {
  principal.role == "doctor"
  && principal.department == resource.patient.assignedDepartment
  && context.purposeOfUse == "treatment"
};
```

### Key Takeaway

**Fine-Grained Authorization = The Last Mile of Security**

You can have perfect authentication (FIDO2, MFA), but if authorization is wrong, anyone can access anything.

**The hierarchy:**
1. **Authentication:** Prove who you are (FIDO2, OAuth, OIDC)
2. **Coarse authorization:** Basic roles (admin, user)
3. **Fine-grained authorization:** Detailed permissions (Zanzibar, Cedar)

**Most important decision:**
- Start simple (RBAC)
- Upgrade to fine-grained when you need Google Drive-like sharing or multi-tenancy
- Choose based on your primary use case (relationships → Zanzibar, policies → Cedar)

## Module 7: Emerging Trends - The Future of Identity

### What Problem Does This Solve?

**In plain English:** What's coming next in identity and security that executives need to understand NOW to stay ahead?

### Trend 1: Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)

#### The Old Model (Perimeter Security)
**Concept:** Hard shell, soft center
```
      🔒 Corporate Firewall 🔒
            (The Moat)
                ↓
        Inside = Trusted
        Outside = Untrusted
```

**Problem:** What if attacker gets inside (phishing, insider threat)?
- Once inside, they can access everything
- 277 days average to detect breach
- VPN = keys to the kingdom

#### The Zero Trust Model
**Concept:** "Never trust, always verify"
```
Every request is authenticated and authorized
              ↓
        No implicit trust
              ↓
   Continuous verification
              ↓
        Least privilege access
```

**Example:** Google BeyondCorp
- Employees access apps from anywhere (coffee shop, home, office)
- Every request verified: Device health + User identity + Context
- No VPN needed
- Breached laptop? Limited damage (per-request verification)

#### Key Principles

1. **Verify explicitly**
   - Check: User identity + Device posture + Location + Time
   - Don't assume: "Inside network = trusted"

2. **Least privilege access**
   - Grant: Minimum necessary permissions
   - Limit: Blast radius of compromised credentials

3. **Assume breach**
   - Monitor: All activity (users, devices, services)
   - Segment: Network (lateral movement prevention)
   - Encrypt: Everything (data at rest, in transit)

#### Business Impact

**Security:**
- 70% reduction in breach impact (Google case study)
- Faster incident response (continuous monitoring)
- Better insider threat detection

**Productivity:**
- Work from anywhere (no VPN bottleneck)
- Faster app access (no network routing)
- Better user experience

**Cost:**
- Reduce VPN infrastructure costs
- Lower breach remediation costs ($4.45M → $1.5M average)
- Enable cloud migration

#### Implementation Phases

**Phase 1: Identity (0-6 months)**
- Strong authentication (MFA, FIDO2)
- Single Sign-On across apps
- Conditional access policies

**Phase 2: Devices (6-12 months)**
- Device inventory and health checks
- Endpoint detection and response (EDR)
- Mobile device management (MDM)

**Phase 3: Networks (12-18 months)**
- Micro-segmentation
- Software-defined perimeter (SDP)
- Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)

**Phase 4: Data (18-24 months)**
- Data classification
- Encryption everywhere
- Data loss prevention (DLP)

### Trend 2: Continuous Access Evaluation (CAE)

#### The Old Model (Session-Based)
```
User logs in → Gets 8-hour session → Trusted for 8 hours
```

**Problem:** What if:
- User is fired at 10am, session valid until 6pm?
- User's laptop stolen at 2pm?
- Attacker hijacks session token?

#### The New Model (Continuous Verification)
```
User logs in → Every request is re-evaluated → Instant revocation
```

**Checks on every request:**
- Is session still valid?
- Has user's risk score changed?
- Is device still compliant?
- Has IP address changed suspiciously?
- Has password been compromised (in breach database)?

#### Real-World Example: Microsoft CAE

**Scenario:** Employee fired at 10:00am
- **Old way:** Access revoked, but existing sessions valid for hours
- **CAE way:** Access revoked globally in `<5` minutes, all sessions terminated

**Scenario:** User's password appears in breach
- **Old way:** Hope they change it before attacker uses it
- **CAE way:** Immediate session termination, force re-authentication

#### Business Impact

**Security:**
- `<5` min revocation time (vs. 8 hours)
- Real-time risk response
- Prevent session hijacking

**Compliance:**
- Meet instant deprovisioning requirements
- Real-time audit logs
- Demonstrate continuous control

**User Experience:**
- Mostly invisible (when things are normal)
- Only re-auth when risk detected
- Better than periodic forced logouts

### Trend 3: Decentralized Identity / Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)

#### The Problem with Current Identity

**Current model:**
```
Google knows your email and browsing
Facebook knows your social connections
Your bank knows your financial history
Your employer knows your work history

You = fragmented across 100s of silos
You = don't control your own data
```

#### The Self-Sovereign Identity Vision

**New model:**
```
You own your identity (in your digital wallet)
You control what you share (selective disclosure)
You prove claims without exposing data (zero-knowledge proofs)
```

**Example Scenario:**
- Bar: "Prove you're over 21"
- **Old way:** Show driver's license (exposes name, address, birthday)
- **SSI way:** Digital credential proves "age > 21" without revealing birthday

#### Key Technologies

**Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs):**
```
did:example:123456789abcdefghi
```
- You control it (not Google, not Facebook)
- Cryptographically verifiable
- Works across systems

**Verifiable Credentials (VCs):**
- Digital diplomas, licenses, certifications
- Cryptographically signed by issuer
- You hold them, share when needed

**Digital Wallets:**
- Store your DIDs and credentials
- Like Apple Wallet but for identity
- You control what's shared

#### Real-World Adoption

**European Union (eIDAS 2.0):**
- Mandating digital identity wallets by 2026
- 80% of citizens to have access
- Use for: Government services, banking, healthcare

**U.S. State Governments:**
- Mobile driver's licenses (mDL)
- Apple Wallet, Google Wallet support
- TSA accepting at airports

**Enterprise:**
- Verifiable employment credentials
- Professional certifications
- Educational transcripts

#### Business Impact (Next 3-5 Years)

**For Consumers:**
- Own your data (GDPR "data portability" on steroids)
- Selective disclosure (privacy by design)
- Reduce identity theft (credentials can't be stolen from centralized DB)

**For Enterprises:**
- Verify credentials instantly (diplomas, certifications)
- Reduce identity verification costs (trust cryptographic proof)
- New business models (verified identity marketplaces)

**For Governments:**
- Digital-native identity (born in 2025 = digital from day 1)
- Cross-border recognition (EU wallet works in US)
- Fraud reduction (cryptographic proof vs. fake documents)

### Trend 4: Passwordless + Passkeys (Mainstream Adoption)

#### Current State (2025)

**Adoption rates:**
- Google: 50% of users now using passkeys
- Apple: 20% adoption since iOS 16 (2022)
- Microsoft: Zero compromised accounts with FIDO2 (2+ years)
- GitHub: Passkeys supported, mandatory for high-risk users

**Industry shift:**
- "Passwordless" was buzzword in 2020
- Production-ready in 2022 (Apple/Google/Microsoft collaboration)
- Mainstream by 2025
- Expected: 75% of enterprises passwordless by 2027

#### What Changed in 2022-2025

**Before 2022:**
- FIDO2 required hardware key (YubiKey, Titan)
- Lose key = lose access
- Not synced across devices

**After 2022 (Passkeys):**
- Synced via iCloud Keychain (Apple)
- Synced via Google Password Manager (Android)
- Works across all devices
- Can't be lost (cloud backup)
- Still unphishable

#### Business Impact

**For B2C:**
- 30% higher conversion (passwordless login)
- 90% reduction in credential support tickets
- Better mobile UX (biometric > typing password)

**For B2B:**
- Zero phishing risk (government mandate driver)
- Compliance advantage (exceed NIST standards)
- Employee productivity (faster login)

**For Enterprises:**
- Immediate: Require passkeys for admins/executives
- 12 months: Offer to all employees
- 24 months: Phase out passwords entirely

### What Executives Need to Do NOW

#### 1. Start Zero Trust Journey
**Action items:**
- Audit: What's your current trust model?
- Implement: MFA for all users (if not done)
- Plan: 18-24 month Zero Trust roadmap
- Vendor: Evaluate ZTNA solutions (Zscaler, Cloudflare, Palo Alto)

#### 2. Enable Passkeys/Passwordless
**Action items:**
- Immediate: Offer passkeys as optional login method
- Q2 2025: Mandate for executives and IT admins
- Q4 2025: Default for all new accounts
- 2026: Phase out passwords

#### 3. Implement CAE
**Action items:**
- If using Okta/Azure AD: Enable CAE features
- Set policies: IP change, device compliance, risk score
- Test: Revocation time (should be `<5` min)
- Monitor: False positive rate

#### 4. Watch Decentralized Identity
**Action items:**
- Monitor: EU digital wallet rollout (2026)
- Pilot: Verifiable credential use case (diplomas, certifications)
- Partner: With wallet providers (Apple, Google, govt initiatives)
- Plan: 3-5 year timeline for SSI impact

### Key Takeaway

**The Future is Already Here, Unevenly Distributed**

- **Zero Trust:** Google doing it for 10 years, now mainstream
- **Passkeys:** Apple/Google/Microsoft shipped it, now it's adoption phase
- **CAE:** Microsoft/Okta have it, others catching up
- **SSI:** EU mandating it, early adoption phase

**Executive action:** Don't wait for "perfect" solutions. Start experimenting NOW with these technologies or risk falling behind competitors.

**Timeline:**
- **2025:** Passkeys mainstream, Zero Trust expected
- **2026:** EU digital wallets, CAE standard
- **2027:** 75% enterprises passwordless
- **2028-2030:** Decentralized identity goes mainstream
