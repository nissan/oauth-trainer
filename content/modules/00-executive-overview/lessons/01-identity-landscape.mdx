## What is Identity & Access Management?

### The Two-Second Explanation

**Authentication** = "Who are you?"
**Authorization** = "What can you do?"

Every digital interaction requires both. IAM is the technology that makes this secure, scalable, and user-friendly.

## Why IAM Matters to Your Business

### Security Impact
- **81% of data breaches** involve compromised credentials
- **Average cost of a breach**: $4.45 million (2023)
- **Time to detect**: 277 days on average

**Bottom line:** Poor IAM = Your biggest security vulnerability

### Business Impact
- **User experience**: Password fatigue causes 40% cart abandonment
- **Productivity**: Employees spend 11 hours/year on password resets
- **Compliance**: GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2 all require proper IAM
- **Revenue**: Seamless authentication increases conversion rates by 30%+

**Bottom line:** Good IAM = Better UX, lower costs, happier customers

### Digital Transformation
- **Cloud migration**: Can't happen without modern IAM
- **API economy**: Every API needs authentication
- **Remote work**: Zero Trust requires sophisticated IAM
- **Customer 360**: Single identity across all touchpoints

**Bottom line:** IAM is the foundation of digital transformation

## The IAM Problem Space

### Problem 1: Too Many Passwords
**Reality:**
- Average person has 100+ online accounts
- Uses the same password for 65% of them
- 51% write passwords on sticky notes

**Risk:** One breach compromises everything

### Problem 2: Fragmented Identity
**Reality:**
- Your identity is scattered across hundreds of systems
- Google has your email, LinkedIn has your professional data, banks have your financial identity
- No single source of truth

**Risk:** Data inconsistency, privacy violations, poor UX

### Problem 3: Insider Threats
**Reality:**
- 34% of breaches involve internal actors
- Employees have access to far more than needed
- No visibility into who accesses what

**Risk:** Data exfiltration, compliance violations

### Problem 4: Regulatory Compliance
**Reality:**
- GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, SOC 2, ISO 27001
- Each requires different controls
- Fines up to 4% of global revenue

**Risk:** Massive fines, reputational damage

### Problem 5: The Password Paradox
**Reality:**
- Make passwords strong → Users can't remember them
- Make them simple → Easily hacked
- Add MFA → Friction kills conversion
- Remove MFA → Security risk

**Risk:** No-win situation with traditional approaches

## The IAM Technology Stack

Modern IAM involves multiple technologies working together. Here's the landscape:

### Layer 1: Authentication (Proving Who You Are)

#### Traditional Methods
- **Passwords**: Everyone knows them, everyone hates them, still 80% of logins
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Something you know + something you have + something you are
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Log in once, access everything

#### Modern Methods
- **Passwordless**: FIDO2/WebAuthn, biometrics, magic links
- **Decentralized Identity**: You own your identity (Self-Sovereign Identity)
- **Continuous Authentication**: Always verifying, not just at login

**Key Message:** We're moving from passwords to passwordless to user-controlled identity.

### Layer 2: Authorization (Controlling What You Can Do)

#### Simple Approaches
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**: User X can access Resource Y
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Roles have permissions, users have roles

#### Advanced Approaches
- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: Policies based on user/resource attributes
- **Relationship-Based Access Control (ReBAC)**: Google Drive-style sharing graphs
- **Fine-Grained Authorization**: Google Zanzibar, Amazon Cedar

**Key Message:** Moving from roles to relationships to policies to handle complex scenarios.

### Layer 3: Federation (Connecting Systems)

#### Protocols
- **OAuth 2.0**: Delegated authorization ("Let app X access your Google data")
- **OpenID Connect (OIDC)**: Authentication layer on OAuth ("Sign in with Google")
- **SAML 2.0**: Enterprise federation (older, XML-based)

**Key Message:** Let users bring their existing identity instead of creating new accounts.

### Layer 4: Governance (Who Has Access to What)

#### Key Capabilities
- **Identity Lifecycle Management**: Onboarding, changes, offboarding
- **Access Reviews**: Regular audits of who has access
- **Privileged Access Management (PAM)**: Special controls for admins
- **Identity Analytics**: Detect anomalies, risky access patterns

**Key Message:** It's not just about granting access, but managing it over time.

## Strategic Decision Framework

### Key Questions Every Executive Should Ask

#### 1. "What's our identity strategy?"

**Good answers:**
- ✅ "Passwordless by 2026, FIDO2 deployment in progress"
- ✅ "Zero Trust architecture with continuous verification"
- ✅ "Customer identity separate from employee identity"

**Red flags:**
- ❌ "We use Active Directory" (That's a tool, not a strategy)
- ❌ "IT handles that" (C-suite issue, not just IT)
- ❌ "Passwords with mandatory 90-day rotation" (Outdated thinking)

#### 2. "How quickly can we revoke access?"

**Benchmark:** Should be `<5` minutes for any employee, contractor, or customer.

**Why it matters:**
- Departed employees retain access for average of 8 days
- Compromised credentials go undetected for 277 days
- Time is money in breach scenarios ($4.45M average cost)

#### 3. "Do we know who has access to what?"

**Test:** Can you, right now, list everyone with access to:
- Customer financial data?
- Source code repositories?
- Production databases?

If no → You have an IAM governance problem.

#### 4. "What happens if our identity provider goes down?"

**Scenarios to plan for:**
- Okta outage (happened in 2023)
- Google Workspace breach
- Auth0 service interruption

**Strategy:** Multi-provider redundancy or self-hosted backup.

#### 5. "Are we compliant?"

**Requirements to track:**
| Regulation | Key IAM Requirements |
|------------|---------------------|
| **GDPR** | Consent management, right to delete, data portability |
| **HIPAA** | Access logs, minimum necessary access, encryption |
| **PCI-DSS** | MFA for all access, regular access reviews, privileged access controls |
| **SOC 2** | Access controls, authentication, monitoring, incident response |
| **CCPA** | Consumer data rights, deletion capabilities, access transparency |

#### 6. "What's our passwordless roadmap?"

**Industry trend:** 75% of enterprises will be passwordless by 2027.

**Your roadmap should include:**
- Phase 1: MFA for all users (now)
- Phase 2: Passwordless options for employees (12-18 months)
- Phase 3: Passwordless for customers (18-24 months)
- Phase 4: Eliminate passwords entirely (24-36 months)

## Build vs. Buy Decision Matrix

### When to Build
✅ You're a tech company with identity as core differentiator
✅ You have unique requirements no vendor can meet
✅ You have dedicated IAM engineering team (5+ engineers)
✅ You need complete control and customization

**Example:** Airbnb built their own identity platform

### When to Buy
✅ Identity is not your core business
✅ You need to move fast (< 6 months)
✅ You want vendor support and SLAs
✅ You need compliance certifications (SOC 2, FedRAMP)

**Example:** Most SaaS companies use Auth0, Okta, or similar

### Hybrid Approach
Many companies do both:
- **Buy:** Customer-facing authentication (Auth0, Clerk)
- **Build:** Internal authorization rules (custom policies)
- **Buy:** Employee SSO (Okta, Google Workspace)
- **Build:** Fine-grained permissions (Zanzibar-inspired)

## The Cost of Getting IAM Wrong

### Security Failures
- **Target (2013)**: Breach via HVAC vendor credentials → $162M settlement
- **Capital One (2019)**: Misconfigured IAM permissions → $80M fine
- **SolarWinds (2020)**: Compromised update server → Immeasurable damage

### Compliance Failures
- **British Airways**: GDPR fine £20M for weak authentication
- **Marriott**: £18.4M fine for inadequate access controls
- **Uber**: $148M settlement for covering up breach (IAM governance failure)

### Productivity Losses
- **Password resets**: $70 per reset, 40% of help desk calls
- **Account lockouts**: 15 minutes average resolution time
- **Onboarding delays**: 3-5 days to provision access (should be `<1` hour)

**Annual IAM-related costs for a 1,000-employee company:**
- Password resets: ~$280,000
- Lost productivity: ~$500,000
- Help desk overhead: ~$400,000
- **Total: ~$1.18M/year** (could be reduced 70% with modern IAM)

## Return on Investment (ROI)

### Cost Savings
- **40-50% reduction** in help desk tickets
- **70% faster** employee onboarding
- **30% increase** in customer conversion (better auth UX)
- **90% reduction** in password-related incidents

### Security Improvements
- **95% reduction** in credential-based breaches (with passwordless)
- **80% faster** threat detection and response
- **100% audit** coverage (with proper logging)

### Business Enablers
- **Enable cloud migration**: Can't go cloud without modern IAM
- **Support M&A**: Integrate acquisitions 10x faster
- **Accelerate partnerships**: Federated access with partners
- **Regulatory readiness**: Pass audits 3x faster

**Typical ROI:** 200-400% in 3 years for mid-size companies
