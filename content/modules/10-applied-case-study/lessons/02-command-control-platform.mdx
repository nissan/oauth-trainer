# Command & Control Platform IAM Design

## System Overview

The **Command & Control (C2) Platform** is Apex's mission-critical interface for operators like Sarah Lee. During field operations, operators use this platform to:

- Monitor real-time sensor telemetry from deployed defense units
- Authorize autonomous countermeasure responses
- Coordinate with coalition partners during joint operations
- Access classified threat analysis and mission planning tools

### Security Requirements

| Requirement | Rationale |
|-------------|-----------|
| **High-Assurance Authentication** | Failed authentication during active threat could have life-threatening consequences |
| **Phishing Resistance** | Nation-state adversaries frequently use credential phishing attacks |
| **Multi-Level Access Control** | Different operators have different clearances and mission assignments |
| **Device Trust** | Prevent access from compromised or unauthorized endpoints |
| **Federation Support** | Coalition partners authenticate through their own government IdPs |

## Your Task

Design the IAM architecture for Apex's Command & Control platform. Consider how operators authenticate, what MFA mechanisms provide sufficient assurance, and how access is controlled based on clearance levels and mission context.

  guidingQuestions={[
    "What authentication strategy should Apex use for operators? Should they maintain their own IdP or federate with government identity providers?",
    "How can FIDO2/WebAuthn provide phishing-resistant MFA? What devices should operators use (hardware keys, platform authenticators, smart cards)?",
    "How should attribute-based access control (ABAC) be implemented? What attributes matter (clearance level, mission assignment, geography, time)?",
    "What role does device posture enforcement play? How do you verify that operators are using approved, compliant devices?",
    "How do you balance high security requirements with operational usability during time-sensitive missions?"

  sampleResponse={`**Authentication Strategy:**

Apex should implement **OIDC federation** rather than maintaining their own identity provider:

1. **Government IdP Integration**: Operators authenticate through their respective government identity providers (Australian DTA, US DoD CAC, UK Verify, etc.)
2. **OIDC Claims Mapping**: Map government-issued claims (clearance level, agency affiliation, job role) to Apex's authorization model
3. **Token Exchange**: Use OAuth 2.0 token exchange (RFC 8693) to convert government tokens into Apex-scoped access tokens
4. **Session Management**: Issue short-lived ID tokens (15-30 minutes) with refresh tokens for extended operations

This approach leverages existing high-assurance credentials while maintaining operational control.

**FIDO2/WebAuthn MFA Implementation:**

For phishing-resistant authentication:

- **Hardware Security Keys**: Yubikey 5 Series or similar FIDO2 keys registered to individual operators
- **Platform Authenticators**: Biometric authentication on government-issued tablets/laptops with TPM backing
- **Ceremony Binding**: WebAuthn credentials bound to specific domains (command.apexdefense.gov.au) prevent phishing
- **Attestation Verification**: Require direct attestation to ensure keys meet FIPS 140-2 Level 2+ standards
- **Backup Authenticators**: Secondary FIDO2 device registered for contingency operations

**Attribute-Based Access Control:**

ABAC policy engine evaluating:

1. **Clearance Level**: Secret, Top Secret, TS/SCI encoded in OIDC claims
2. **Mission Context**: Active mission assignments (Operation Northern Shield, Exercise Talisman Sabre)
3. **Geographic Scope**: Regional restrictions (Indo-Pacific Command, European Theater)
4. **Temporal Constraints**: Time-of-day restrictions and emergency override capabilities
5. **Need-to-Know**: Compartmentalized information access based on program affiliation

Implementation via policy-as-code (OPA/Cedar) evaluating claims at each API request.

**Device Posture Enforcement:**

- **Device Registration**: All operator endpoints enrolled in MDM (Microsoft Intune, JAMF Pro)
- **Compliance Checks**: OS patch level, disk encryption, antivirus status verified pre-authentication
- **Certificate-Based Trust**: mTLS with device certificates provisioned during enrollment
- **Conditional Access**: Azure AD/Okta conditional access policies blocking non-compliant devices
- **Runtime Verification**: Continuous posture assessment during active sessions

**Balancing Security and Usability:**

- **Single Sign-On**: OIDC SSO across all C2 subsystems reduces authentication friction
- **Passwordless Flow**: FIDO2 eliminates password memorization while increasing security
- **Emergency Access**: Break-glass procedures with enhanced logging for time-critical scenarios
- **Cached Credentials**: Limited offline operation (2-4 hours) for field environments with degraded connectivity
- **Adaptive MFA**: Step-up authentication only for privileged actions (weapon authorization, mission plan changes)`}

## Key Considerations

As you design this system, consider:

- **User Experience**: Operators like Sarah need fast, reliable access during high-stress situations
- **Interoperability**: Coalition partners from different nations use different identity systems
- **Assurance Levels**: NIST 800-63 AAL3 (Authenticator Assurance Level) is likely required
- **Incident Response**: How do you handle compromised credentials or devices in the field?

Your design should demonstrate how modern IAM standards (OIDC, FIDO2, ABAC) can meet defense-grade security requirements while maintaining operational effectiveness.
