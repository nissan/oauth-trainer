# Field Units & Offline Authorization

## System Overview

Apex's **field-deployed autonomous units** represent the most challenging IAM scenario: systems that must operate independently in contested, disconnected, or air-gapped environments. These include:

- **Mobile countermeasure platforms**: Vehicle-mounted systems that may operate 100+ km from base
- **Stationary sensor arrays**: Forward-deployed units in remote locations without reliable connectivity
- **Autonomous response systems**: AI-driven units that must make split-second decisions without human intervention

### Operational Challenges

| Challenge | Impact | IAM Requirement |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| **No Network Connectivity** | Units operate for hours/days without cloud access | Cached credentials and local authorization |
| **Physical Access Risk** | Adversaries may attempt to extract credentials or tamper with firmware | Hardware-protected key storage and secure boot |
| **Autonomous Decision Making** | Systems must authorize countermeasure actions without human confirmation | Pre-provisioned authorization proofs |
| **Emergency Activation** | Operators must activate systems rapidly during active threat | Secure but fast local authentication |
| **Firmware Integrity** | Compromised firmware could disable defenses or cause friendly-fire | Cryptographic verification at boot |

## Your Task

Design the authentication and authorization architecture for Apex's field-deployed autonomous systems. Focus on offline operation, local security, and hardware-based trust anchors.

  sampleResponse={`**Offline Authorization Strategy:**

Autonomous systems must cache limited-duration authorization proofs:

1. **Pre-Provisioned JWT Tokens**: Before deployment, systems download signed JWT assertions containing:
   - Authorized countermeasure actions (defensive only, all capabilities, etc.)
   - Valid geographic operating area (geofenced authorization)
   - Temporal validity (24-72 hour maximum)
   - Mission context (training exercise, active defense, coalition operation)

2. **Capability Tokens**: RFC 7519 (JWT) claims encoding specific permissions:
   \`\`\`json
   {"{"}
     "sub": "unit:apex-cm-42981",
     "authorized_actions": ["detect", "classify", "engage_defensive"],
     "geo_fence": "lat:35.5,lon:139.8,radius:50km",
     "mission": "operation-northern-shield",
     "nbf": 1640000000,
     "exp": 1640259600
   {"}"}
   \`\`\`

3. **Local Policy Engine**: Embedded OPA/Cedar policy engine evaluates cached tokens against real-time threat data
4. **Grace Period**: Systems operate up to 72 hours offline; return to base/connectivity for token refresh
5. **Audit Trail**: All autonomous actions logged to encrypted local storage; uploaded when connectivity resumes

**TPM-Based Local Authentication:**

Trusted Platform Module provides hardware security:

- **Key Protection**: All cryptographic keys stored in TPM; private keys never leave hardware
- **Local Operator Authentication**: Field activation requires FIDO2 passkey stored in operator's smart card + TPM attestation
- **PCR (Platform Configuration Register) Sealing**: Credentials unsealed only if firmware/boot state is unmodified
- **Measured Boot**: TPM records hash chain of boot components; attestation proves system integrity
- **Emergency Override**: Physical security module (HSM-in-a-box) with multi-factor unlock for mission-critical scenarios

**Secure Boot Process:**

Multi-stage firmware verification:

1. **Hardware Root of Trust**: Immutable ROM bootloader with manufacturer public key
2. **Stage 1**: ROM verifies bootloader signature (ECDSA P-384)
3. **Stage 2**: Bootloader verifies kernel signature
4. **Stage 3**: Kernel verifies application firmware signature
5. **Rollback Prevention**: TPM-stored version counters prevent downgrade attacks
6. **Integrity Failure**: Boot halts if any signature invalid; enters recovery mode requiring physical technician access

All signatures verified against Apex PKI; update signatures include timestamp and device authorization claims.

**Local Operator Activation:**

Field operators activate systems via:

- **FIDO2 Security Token**: Yubikey or CAC card with WebAuthn/CTAP2 credential
- **Platform Authenticator**: Biometric authentication (fingerprint) on operator tablet bound to TPM
- **Challenge-Response**: System generates nonce, operator signs with FIDO2 key, system verifies signature
- **Time-Limited Session**: Operator authentication grants 4-8 hour local access; re-authentication required for sensitive actions
- **Emergency Access**: Break-glass physical keyswitch + radio authentication code for extreme scenarios

No passwords; all authentication hardware-backed.

**Balancing Autonomy and Risk:**

Risk mitigation for autonomous operation:

- **Graduated Authorization**: Training mode (detect only) → Defensive mode (limited engagement) → Full authorization
- **Behavioral Constraints**: AI models trained with strict rules of engagement; non-combatant detection mandatory
- **Dead Man's Switch**: Systems auto-disable after 72 hours without operator re-authentication
- **Remote Kill**: Encrypted radio command with multiple-signature requirement can disable compromised units
- **Tamper Detection**: Hardware sensors detect case intrusion; system zeroizes keys and enters inert mode
- **Accountability**: Every autonomous action logged with cryptographic proof of authorization token and decision context`}

## Key Considerations

As you design for offline operation, think about:

- **Battery Life**: Cryptographic operations consume power; how do you minimize energy usage?
- **Physical Tampering**: What if an adversary captures a unit and attempts to extract credentials?
- **Software Updates**: How do you update firmware for units that are rarely connected?
- **Clock Synchronization**: JWT expiration requires accurate time; what if the system clock is wrong?
- **Mission Abort**: How do operators remotely disable units if mission parameters change?

Your design should demonstrate understanding of hardware security modules (TPM), secure boot chains, and the challenges of authorization without real-time network connectivity.
