# Partner Integration & Coalition Federation

## System Overview

Apex Defense Systems operates in a **coalition environment**, collaborating with:

- **Allied defense agencies**: NATO members, Five Eyes partners (US, UK, Canada, New Zealand)
- **Government contractors**: Civilian companies providing specialized services (maintenance, training, logistics)
- **Research institutions**: Universities and labs working on AI/ML threat models
- **Equipment suppliers**: Hardware manufacturers requiring access for support and diagnostics

### Integration Challenges

| Partner Type | Users | Identity System | Access Needs | Trust Level |
|--------------|-------|----------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Allied Military (NATO)** | 50-100 analysts | Government PKI + LDAP | Full mission data, limited control access | High |
| **Five Eyes Agencies** | 20-40 analysts | National IdPs (varied) | Specific operation data, AI models | High |
| **Defense Contractors** | 30-60 engineers | Corporate Azure AD / Okta | Maintenance APIs, diagnostic telemetry | Medium |
| **Research Partners** | 10-20 scientists | University Shibboleth/SAML | Anonymized sensor data, model training | Medium-Low |
| **Equipment Vendors** | 5-15 technicians | Vendor corporate IdP | Limited device diagnostics, update delivery | Low |

## Your Task

Design the federated identity architecture for Apex's partner ecosystem. Address SSO for coalition operations, temporary contractor access, and automated user lifecycle management.

  sampleResponse={`**SAML 2.0 vs. OIDC for Coalition SSO:**

**Recommendation: SAML 2.0 for allied military, OIDC for modern partners**

Rationale:
- **SAML 2.0 Advantages**: Established standard in government/defense, supports complex attribute assertions, works with legacy systems (Active Directory Federation Services, Shibboleth)
- **OIDC Advantages**: Modern, mobile-friendly, better developer experience, JSON-based (easier integration)

Implementation:

1. **SAML 2.0 for NATO/Five Eyes**:
   - Apex acts as Service Provider (SP)
   - Partner governments act as Identity Providers (IdP)
   - SAML assertions contain clearance, nationality, agency, role
   - Bilateral trust established via metadata exchange and certificate validation
   - Attribute mapping: SAML attributes → Apex authorization claims

2. **OIDC for Modern Partners**:
   - Azure AD, Okta, Google Workspace federation via OIDC
   - Apex registered as relying party with each partner IdP
   - ID tokens contain email, organization, role claims
   - Dynamic client registration where supported

3. **Legacy Support**:
   - SAML-to-OIDC bridge for partners requiring both protocols
   - WS-Federation support for older Microsoft environments

**OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange (RFC 8693):**

Delegated contractor access without direct federation:

1. **Contractor Authentication**: Engineer authenticates with their company IdP (e.g., Lockheed Martin Azure AD)
2. **Initial Token**: Receives OAuth access token from their organization
3. **Token Exchange Request**: Sends token to Apex authorization server:
   \`\`\`http
   POST /token HTTP/1.1
   Host: auth.apexdefense.gov.au
   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

   grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange
   &subject_token=eyJhbGci...  (contractor's original token)
   &subject_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token
   &scope=read:telemetry write:maintenance-logs
   &audience=https://api.apexdefense.gov.au
   \`\`\`

4. **Token Validation**: Apex validates contractor token with partner IdP
5. **Scoped Token Issuance**: Apex issues limited-scope access token with:
   - Short lifetime (1-4 hours)
   - Restricted scopes based on contract terms
   - Audit trail linking to original identity

6. **API Access**: Contractor uses Apex-issued token for authorized operations

Benefits: Partner doesn't need full federation infrastructure; Apex maintains fine-grained control.

**SCIM 2.0 User Lifecycle Management:**

Automated provisioning across organizational boundaries:

1. **SCIM Server**: Apex operates SCIM 2.0 endpoint for partner-initiated provisioning
2. **Partner SCIM Clients**: Allied agencies push user lifecycle events:
   - **Provisioning**: New analyst joins Indo-Pacific desk → automatically provisioned in Apex with appropriate clearance
   - **Attribute Updates**: Analyst clearance upgraded → Apex access rights automatically updated
   - **Deprovisioning**: Analyst leaves agency → Apex access immediately revoked

3. **SCIM Schema Extensions**: Custom attributes for defense context:
   \`\`\`json
   {"{"}
     "schemas": ["urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User",
                 "urn:apex:scim:extension:security:1.0"],
     "userName": "martinez@nato.int",
     "name": {"{"}"givenName": "Elena", "familyName": "Martinez"{"}"},
     "urn:apex:scim:extension:security:1.0": {"{"}
       "clearanceLevel": "NATO_SECRET",
       "caveats": ["COSMIC_TOP_SECRET"],
       "nationality": "ESP",
       "organization": "NATO_ACO",
       "needToKnow": ["BALTIC_OPS"]
     {"}"}
   {"}"}
   \`\`\`

4. **Bidirectional Sync**: Apex can also push updates back to partners (e.g., training completion, certification status)
5. **Just-in-Time Provisioning**: For ad-hoc access, SAML/OIDC assertions trigger automatic account creation

**Trust and Security Posture Management:**

Tiered controls based on partner trust level:

**High Trust (Allied Military)**:
- Direct SAML federation
- Long-lived sessions (8 hours)
- Broad authorization scope
- Mutual security assessments

**Medium Trust (Defense Contractors)**:
- Token exchange with short lifetimes (1-2 hours)
- Step-up authentication for sensitive operations
- Network egress controls (no data export)
- Quarterly security audits required

**Low Trust (Equipment Vendors)**:
- API key authentication (not federated SSO)
- Read-only access to specific devices
- Heavily rate-limited
- All actions logged and reviewed

**Additional Controls**:
- **Conditional Access**: Contractor access only from approved IP ranges
- **Data Loss Prevention**: Watermarking, download limits, screenshot prevention
- **Session Recording**: Privileged vendor access fully recorded
- **Time-Limited Access**: Contractor tokens valid only during contract period

**Attribute Mapping and Claims Transformation:**

Cross-organizational authorization requires attribute translation:

1. **Clearance Mapping**:
   - NATO SECRET → Apex CONFIDENTIAL
   - US TOP SECRET → Apex SECRET
   - Five Eyes TS/SCI → Apex TOP SECRET

2. **Role Mapping**:
   - NATO Intelligence Analyst → Apex Analyst (Read-Only)
   - US DoD Program Manager → Apex Mission Coordinator (Read-Write)
   - Contractor Engineer → Apex Maintenance Technician (Limited)

3. **Claims Transformation Pipeline**:
   - Ingest SAML attributes / OIDC claims
   - Apply mapping rules (policy-as-code)
   - Inject transformed claims into Apex access tokens
   - Enforce mapped attributes in authorization decisions

4. **Provenance Tracking**: All authorization decisions log original partner claims for audit`}

## Key Considerations

Think about these federation challenges:

- **Trust Establishment**: How do you verify partner IdPs are legitimate? What certificate validation is required?
- **Attribute Reliability**: Can you trust clearance claims from all partners equally? How do you verify?
- **Revocation**: If a partner relationship ends, how quickly can you revoke all federated access?
- **Legal Agreements**: SAML/OIDC federation requires bilateral agreements; what are the legal requirements?
- **Incident Response**: If a partner IdP is compromised, how do you respond?

Your design should demonstrate understanding of federation protocols (SAML, OIDC), token exchange patterns, and the complexities of cross-organizational identity and access management.
