# Cloud Telemetry & AI Systems Security

## System Overview

Apex's **Cloud Telemetry & AI Systems** process real-time data from thousands of deployed sensors and autonomous units. This infrastructure:

- Ingests telemetry streams (radar signatures, acoustic patterns, visual feeds)
- Runs AI/ML models for threat classification and pattern recognition
- Stores classified sensor data in compliance with defense regulations
- Provides federated access to partner agencies for coalition operations
- Delivers firmware and AI model updates to field-deployed systems

### Architecture Components

| Component | Function | Identity Challenge |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Deployed Sensors** | Autonomous units transmitting telemetry | How to authenticate thousands of devices? |
| **Telemetry Gateway** | API endpoint receiving sensor data | How to prevent spoofed sensor data? |
| **AI Processing Pipeline** | Threat analysis and classification | How to control access to classified models? |
| **Update Distribution** | Firmware/model delivery system | How to ensure update integrity and authenticity? |
| **Partner Portal** | Federated access for allied agencies | How to share data while maintaining access control? |

## Your Task

Design the machine identity and data protection strategy for Apex's cloud telemetry infrastructure. Focus on device authentication, secure updates, and federated partner access.

  sampleResponse={`**Device Identity and Authentication:**

Every deployed sensor/unit receives cryptographic identity at manufacture:

1. **X.509 Device Certificates**: PKI certificates issued during production, stored in hardware-protected key storage (TPM 2.0 or secure element)
2. **Certificate Hierarchy**: Root CA operated by Apex, intermediate CAs per product line, unique leaf certificates per device
3. **OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Flow**: Devices authenticate using mTLS with their device certificate to obtain access tokens
4. **Token Lifecycle**: Short-lived access tokens (1-4 hours) with automatic renewal using certificate-based client authentication
5. **Device Registration**: Certificate serial numbers mapped to device metadata (model, manufacturing date, deployment location) in device registry

This creates verifiable machine identity that cannot be cloned or replayed.

**mTLS Implementation:**

- **Mutual TLS**: Both client (device) and server (telemetry gateway) verify each other's certificates
- **Certificate Pinning**: Devices trust only Apex's root CA, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks
- **Token Binding**: Access tokens cryptographically bound to device certificate using mTLS-based confirmation claims
- **Connection Security**: TLS 1.3 with approved cipher suites (CNSA Suite for Top Secret data)

**Secure Firmware and AI Model Updates:**

Multi-layered update security:

1. **Code Signing**: All firmware images signed with Apex's private key (ECDSA P-384 or RSA 4096)
2. **JWT-Based Manifests**: Update packages include signed JWT assertions containing:
   - Firmware version and hash
   - Authorized device models
   - Deployment authorization level
   - Expiration timestamp
3. **Secure Boot Chain**: Devices verify signature before loading firmware; rollback prevention
4. **Staged Rollout**: Updates delivered via OAuth-protected API requiring device authentication
5. **Attestation**: Devices report successful update installation with TPM-signed attestation

This ensures only authentic, authorized updates can be installed.

**Partner Agency Federation:**

For allied defense organizations accessing telemetry:

- **OIDC Federation**: Partner IdPs (NATO LDAP, Five Eyes systems) federate via OIDC
- **Claims Mapping**: Partner identity claims mapped to Apex authorization model (clearance level, coalition affiliation, need-to-know)
- **Token Exchange**: RFC 8693 token exchange converts partner tokens to Apex-scoped access tokens
- **API Gateway**: OAuth 2.0 protected APIs with scope-based authorization (read:telemetry:indo-pacific, read:analysis:classified)
- **Audit Logging**: Full traceability of partner data access exported to SIEM

**Scoping and Permissions:**

Granular OAuth scopes prevent over-privileged access:

- **Mission-Based Scopes**: read:telemetry:operation-northern-shield
- **Geographic Scopes**: read:sensors:indo-pacific-region
- **Classification Scopes**: read:data:top-secret, read:data:secret
- **Capability Scopes**: read:ai-models:threat-classification, write:sensor-config
- **Claims-Based Enforcement**: Policy engine evaluates clearance claims against requested scopes

Authorization decision made per-request using policy-as-code (OPA) evaluating JWT claims.`}

## Key Considerations

Think about these technical challenges:

- **Scale**: Thousands of sensors generating telemetry simultaneously
- **Certificate Lifecycle**: How do you renew certificates for devices deployed in the field for years?
- **Revocation**: How do you revoke credentials for compromised or decommissioned devices?
- **Offline Operations**: Some sensors may cache data and upload in batches when connectivity returns
- **Supply Chain Security**: How do you prevent counterfeit devices from authenticating?

Your design should demonstrate how machine identity differs from human identity and why standards like X.509, mTLS, and OAuth Client Credentials are essential for IoT/sensor security.
