# Authentication vs Authorization: The Foundation

Two concepts form the bedrock of Identity and Access Management (IAM): **authentication** and **authorization**. While often confused, they serve distinct purposes in securing systems.

## Authentication: Proving Who You Are

**Authentication** is the process of verifying identity. When you log into a system, you prove you are who you claim to be.

Common authentication factors include:
- **Something you know**: Password, PIN, security questions
- **Something you have**: Phone, hardware token, smart card
- **Something you are**: Fingerprint, facial recognition, iris scan

**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** combines two or more factors for stronger security. For example, password + SMS code or password + fingerprint.

## Authorization: Deciding What You Can Do

**Authorization** determines what an authenticated user is permitted to access or perform. It happens *after* authentication.

Examples:
- An employee can view company documents but only managers can approve expenses
- A user can read their own profile but only admins can delete users
- A mobile app can access your photos but not your contacts (if you only granted photo permission)

Authorization answers: "Now that I know who you are, what are you allowed to do?"

## Real-World Analogy

Think of airport security:

1. **Authentication**: You show your ID and boarding pass to prove you're the person on the ticket
2. **Authorization**: The gate agent checks if your ticket allows you to board *this specific flight* at *this specific time*

Your ID proves who you are. Your ticket grants you permission to board.

## In Practice: Web Applications

When you sign into a web application:

1. **Authentication**: You enter username and password. The system verifies these credentials and issues a session token
2. **Authorization**: On each request, the system checks the token to determine what resources you can access

These processes are separate but complementary. Strong authentication without proper authorization leaves data exposed. Granular authorization without reliable authentication cannot trust user identity.
