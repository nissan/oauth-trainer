# IAM Evolution: From LDAP to FIDO

Identity and Access Management has evolved over decades, driven by changing technology landscapes, security threats, and user expectations. Understanding this evolution provides context for why modern protocols exist.

## LDAP Era: Directory Services (1990s-2000s)

**Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)** emerged as the standard for centralized user directories.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Centralized user storage (username, password, attributes)
- Hierarchical data structure (Organizational Units)
- Used by Active Directory, OpenLDAP
- Primarily for internal networks (VPNs, corporate apps)

**Limitations:**
- Not designed for web-based authentication
- Credential validation requires direct LDAP access (security risk)
- No federation support (each app needs LDAP integration)
- Poor fit for cloud and mobile

**Legacy:** LDAP still powers enterprise directories, but modern systems use it as a backend with federation layers on top.

## SAML Era: Enterprise Federation (2000s-2010s)

**Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML 2.0)** brought federation to the enterprise.

**Innovation:**
- XML-based assertions carrying user identity
- Single Sign-On (SSO) across web applications
- Trust between Identity Providers and Service Providers
- Eliminated password sharing between systems

**Use Case:**
Employee authenticates to corporate IdP (e.g., Active Directory Federation Services). Browser carries SAML assertion to SaaS apps (Salesforce, Workday, Slack) without re-authenticating.

**Why It Dominated:**
- Enterprise-focused (legal agreements, trust frameworks)
- Strong security (XML signatures, encryption)
- Mature vendor ecosystem (Shibboleth, Ping Identity)

**Limitations:**
- XML complexity (verbose, hard to debug)
- Poor mobile support (designed for browsers)
- Security vulnerabilities (XML Signature Wrapping attacks)
- Not developer-friendly

## OAuth 2.0: Delegated Authorization (2012)

**OAuth 2.0** revolutionized how applications access user data without seeing passwords.

**Problem Solved:**
Before OAuth, users gave apps their passwords:
- Twitter app wants to post tweets → user gives app their Twitter password
- Security disaster: apps store passwords, full account access, hard to revoke

**OAuth Solution:**
- User authorizes app at the IdP (Twitter)
- IdP issues an access token to the app
- App uses token to access APIs (no password needed)
- User can revoke access anytime

**Key Flows:**
- **Authorization Code Flow**: Browser-based apps (most secure)
- **Client Credentials Flow**: Machine-to-machine
- **Device Code Flow**: TVs, IoT devices

**Impact:**
- Enabled API economy (Twitter, GitHub, Google APIs)
- Foundation for modern mobile apps
- Delegated access without sharing credentials

**Limitation:**
OAuth only handles **authorization**. It doesn't standardize **authentication** (who the user is).

## OpenID Connect: Authentication Layer (2014)

**OpenID Connect (OIDC)** added authentication on top of OAuth 2.0.

**Innovation:**
- Introduced **ID Token** (JWT) containing user identity
- Standardized user profile claims (email, name, sub)
- Built on OAuth 2.0 (reused flows, added identity layer)

**"Sign in with Google" is OIDC**, not pure OAuth.

**What OIDC Provides:**
1. User authentication proof (ID Token)
2. User profile info (UserInfo endpoint)
3. Standardized discovery (find IdP endpoints automatically)
4. Federation across IdPs

**Why It Won:**
- Developer-friendly (JSON vs XML)
- Mobile-native design
- Ecosystem support (Google, Microsoft, Auth0)
- Works for both consumer (social login) and enterprise (SSO)

**OIDC vs SAML:**
- Both enable SSO
- OIDC: JSON, REST, mobile-friendly, developer-focused
- SAML: XML, enterprise-focused, mature but complex

## FIDO2/WebAuthn: Passwordless Future (2018-Present)

**FIDO2 and WebAuthn** aim to eliminate passwords entirely through public key cryptography.

**How It Works:**
1. User registers device (phone, security key)
2. Device generates a **private key** (never leaves device)
3. Device sends **public key** to website
4. During login, website challenges device
5. Device signs challenge with private key
6. Website verifies signature with public key

**Security Benefits:**
- **Phishing-resistant**: Private key tied to specific domain
- **No shared secrets**: Server breach doesn't expose credentials
- **Hardware-bound**: Credentials tied to device (can't be copied)

**Passkeys:** Synced FIDO2 credentials (iCloud Keychain, Google Password Manager)
- Combine security of FIDO with convenience of sync
- Biometric unlock (Face ID, Touch ID)

**Adoption:**
- Supported by all major browsers
- Integrated into Google, Microsoft, Apple ecosystems
- Growing enterprise adoption (Okta, Azure AD)

**The Future:**
FIDO2 represents the industry's bet on a passwordless future, but passwords will coexist for years during transition.

## Evolution Timeline

```text
1990s: LDAP
        ↓  [Centralized directories]
2000s: SAML 2.0
        ↓  [Enterprise SSO, XML-based federation]
2012:  OAuth 2.0
        ↓  [API authorization, delegated access]
2014:  OpenID Connect
        ↓  [Authentication + OAuth, JSON, mobile-friendly]
2018:  FIDO2 / WebAuthn
        ↓  [Passwordless, public key crypto]
Now:   Hybrid Ecosystems
        → OIDC for authentication
        → OAuth for authorization
        → SAML for legacy enterprise
        → FIDO2 for passwordless
        → Zero Trust principles
```

## Modern IAM Principles

Today's IAM systems combine lessons from this evolution:

**Federation**: Trust external IdPs (don't build your own auth)
**Delegation**: OAuth for API access without passwords
**Standards**: OIDC for authentication, SAML for enterprise
**Passwordless**: FIDO2 for phishing-resistant auth
**Zero Trust**: Never trust, always verify (even inside network)

The trend is clear: **fewer passwords, more cryptography, federated trust**.
