We are building a web app to help users be an SME for
- Authentication vs Authorization — proving who you are vs deciding what you can do.
- Identity Providers (IdPs) — Google, Okta, Azure AD, etc.
- Relying Parties (RPs) — apps that consume authentication assertions.
- Access Tokens, ID Tokens, Refresh Tokens — what each represents.
- Claims, Scopes, and Audiences — structuring user information and intent.
- How modern IAM evolved from LDAP → SAML → OAuth → OIDC → FIDO.
- The importance of federation, delegation, and zero trust in enterprise IAM.
- OAuth 2.0 — Delegated Authorization
- Resource Owner, Client, Authorization Server, Resource Server.
- Authorization Grant Types (Flows) including Authorization Code (browser apps), Client Credentials (machine-to-machine), Device Code (TVs, IoT), Implicit (deprecated), Refresh Token, PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) — securing mobile flows, Scopes — limiting access by capability, Token Introspection & Revocation — managing lifecycle and visibility, Security pitfalls — replay attacks, token leakage, redirect URI manipulation
- OpenID Connect (OIDC) — Authentication Layer over OAuth - OIDC adds a user identity layer to OAuth using a signed ID Token (JWT) and Key Elements of ID Token — identity claims (subject, email, name, nonce, etc.), UserInfo endpoint, Discovery document & JWKS URL, Nonce — protection against replay, OIDC Flows — Hybrid vs Code Flow vs Implicit, Why OAuth alone doesn’t handle authentication, OIDC’s relationship to enterprise SSO., Federation via OIDC vs SAML
- SAML 2.0 — XML-based Federation - Predecessor of OIDC; used in enterprise SSO for decades - Components including Identity Provider (IdP), Service Provider (SP), Assertions (SAMLResponse), Bindings & Profiles (HTTP-Redirect, HTTP-POST), Difference between SAML Assertions and OIDC ID Tokens, Why SAML remains dominant in legacy and enterprise contexts, Challenges (XML Signature Wrapping attacks, complexity, poor mobile support)
- FIDO2, WebAuthn, and Passwordless Authentication - Replace passwords with public key cryptography for user authentication - Components including WebAuthn API — enables browsers to use authenticators, CTAP2 (Client to Authenticator Protocol) — link between devices and authenticators, Passkeys — synced credentials tied to hardware-bound keys, Difference between biometric unlock and biometric authentication, Device-bound vs synced credentials, Security benefits (phishing resistance, cryptographic proof of possession), Integration with IdPs like Okta or Azure AD
Google Zanzibar — Fine-Grained Authorization Model - Zanzibar (Google’s global-scale authorization system) underpins Google Drive, YouTube, and more - Key Concepts including Relationship-based Access Control (ReBAC) instead of simple RBAC/ABAC, Tuple Store → stores “user has relation X on object Y”, Check requests → evaluate access dynamically via graph traversal, Consistency tokens → ensure read-your-write behavior across distributed nodes, How Zanzibar enables “Alice can view this folder because Bob shared it with her via group”, Comparisons to OPA (Open Policy Agent) and AuthZed / SpiceDB., Real-world applications of Zanzibar-style systems in SaaS or data-sharing products
- Emerging IAM Trends - Decentralized Identity (DID) & Verifiable Credentials (VCs) — self-sovereign identity, Continuous Access Evaluation (CAE) — dynamic token invalidation, Zero Trust & BeyondCorp — context-aware, per-request authorization, Identity as Code — managing access policies like infrastructure.
- Speaking as an SME, emphasize Security vs usability trade-offs, Lifecycle management: provisioning, deprovisioning, and auditing, Integration challenges across cloud, mobile, IoT, and SaaS ecosystems, Compliance (GDPR, NIST 800-63B, FIDO Alliance standards), The business case for identity modernization (ROI, breach prevention, user trust)

The site will offer comprehensive lessons on each topic, followed by a quick Q&A of multiple choice questions that will help the user certify themselves as having covered the material.
We will have a reference-docs/ folder with a series of learning materials to help augment creating course content in addition to whatever is discovered via web searches.
