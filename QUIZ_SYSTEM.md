## Technical Implementation

### State Management

```typescript
const [currentQuestionIndex, setCurrentQuestionIndex] = useState(0)
const [selectedAnswers, setSelectedAnswers] = useState<number[]>([])
const [quizCompleted, setQuizCompleted] = useState(false)
const [score, setScore] = useState(0)
const [showExplanation, setShowExplanation] = useState(false)
```

### Score Calculation

```typescript
const finishQuiz = () => {
  let correctCount = 0

  questions.forEach((question, index) => {
    if (selectedAnswers[index] === question.correctAnswer) {
      correctCount++
    }
  })

  const finalScore = Math.round((correctCount / totalQuestions) * 100)
  setScore(finalScore)

  // Record attempt
  recordQuizAttempt(module.id, finalScore, totalQuestions)

  // Award badge if passed
  if (finalScore >= PASSING_SCORE && module.badge) {
    awardBadge(module.badge.id)
  }
}
```

### localStorage Integration

Uses existing functions from `/lib/storage.ts`:

```typescript
// Record quiz attempt
recordQuizAttempt(moduleId: string, score: number, totalQuestions: number)

// Award badge on passing
awardBadge(badgeId: string)

// Retrieve user progress
getUserProgress()
```

## Maintenance Notes

### Adding New Quizzes

When adding new modules, ensure quiz data includes:

```typescript
quiz: {
  passingScore: 80,
  questions: [
    {
      question: "Question text here?",
      options: [
        "Option A",
        "Option B",
        "Option C",
        "Option D"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 0, // Index of correct option (0-3)
      explanation: "Detailed explanation of why this is correct..."
    }
    // ... more questions
  ]
}
```

### Quiz Quality Guidelines

- **10-12 questions per module** (optimal length)
- **4 options per question** (reduce guessing)
- **Clear, unambiguous questions** (avoid trick questions)
- **Detailed explanations** (teach, don't just test)
- **Mix difficulty levels** (easy, medium, hard)
- **Cover all lesson topics** (comprehensive assessment)
- **Avoid "all of the above"** (lazy option writing)
- **Test understanding, not memorization** (application questions)
